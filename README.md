## About The Project

Iâ€™ve always wanted to create an **open-source, free alternative to Synthesia**.  
This is a hobby project aiming to be a tool for people who have no musical background and want to start learning piano.

## Features

- **MIDI Playback** â€“ Load and play any standard `.mid` file  
- **Real-time Visualization** â€“ Notes light up on a virtual piano as they are played  
- **Waterfall Animation** â€“ Animated falling notes for easier practice  
- **Live MIDI Input** â€“ Connect your own MIDI keyboard/controller to learn interactively  
- **Playback Controls** â€“ Functional seek bar with full playback control
- **Dragging** - You can drag the animation up and down to traverse the visualization
- **Hand assignment** - You can enter the "Assign Hands" mode, where you can mark hands as left or right by clicking left or right respectively
- **Practice** - You can practice the pieces at your own pace, if you have created a hand assignment for a piece you can practice the parts seperately
